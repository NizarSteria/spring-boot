= Spring Boot Cache Sample

This sample demonstrates the caching auto-configuration support. Spring's caching
abstraction is supported by many caching libraries, including:

* Any compliant `JSR-107` (JCache) provider
* `EhCache`
* `Hazelcast`
* `Infinispan`
* `Redis`
* `Guava`

There is also a _simple_ provider based on `ConcurrentHashMap`.
